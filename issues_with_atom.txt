What happened?
The atom command does not exist, and/or  not found in bash or cmd.
yes, I looked up and added in path for system enviromental variables C:.... atom/bin

THE FIX I FOUND after numerous google searches
1. open terminal
2. cd %localappdata%
   cd atom
   cd app-1.30.0 [the version you have, can check in atom, help]
   atom.exe --squirrel-install
3. if there is nothing returned back try testing the command atom.
4. SUCCESS!
